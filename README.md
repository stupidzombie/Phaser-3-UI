# Phaser 3 UI by Blobattack.com

This is a UI library for Phaser 3 that right now has a button. Since there was nothing really out there that is simillar, we made this so that if other people are looking for the same thing, for example an easy way to make a working button. We have that, and as we add on to creating [BlobAttack](https://blobattack.com) we will upload more.
